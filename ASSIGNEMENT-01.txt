Question 1
   what is the time,space complexity of following code
        int a=0,b=0;
          for(i=0;i<N;i++)
            {
              a=a+1;
            }
          for(j=0;j<M;j++)
            {
              b=b+j;
            }
ans:   O(N*M)->Time Complexity
       O(1)-> Space Complexity
Question 2
  what does it mean when we say that an algorithm x is a asymptotically more effecient than y
ans:b) X will be a better choice for all inputs except possibly small inputs
